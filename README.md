# ITRI Document Fill

This is a small project I developed for ITRI's [ICAP](https://icap.wda.gov.tw/ap/index.php) office in Taipei, which manages government classes on various practical topics.
When an Excel spreadsheet is put in this directory, with a given format containing the teacher's information, the program should run automatically and fill in the necessary Word documents.

## Automation
The end goal is for the program to be running in the background (I guess), and to be constantly monitoring the directory of interest. When the excel file is inserted into the folder, the `main.py` should run automatically.
